/*Create a class called time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes, 
and seconds. One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize
 it to fixed values. Another member function should display it, in 11:59:59 format and 
 the overloaded + operator to add two times should add two objects of type time passed 
 as arguments.A main() program should create two initialized time objects and one
  that isn’t initialized. Then it should add the two objects together, leaving the
result in the third time object Finally it should display the value of this third object*/
